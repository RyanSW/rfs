# Small File System

This is a test of a small file system for use in embedded web servers. The file system can be linked into the generated executable and flashed inside it. This is a read-only memory-resident filesystem that prioritizes directory search times. A c library implements functions for reading and counting files and an encoder utility implements encoding a folder to this format.
